Using Bootstrap 3 or MDL and jQuery create a single page web application that allows a user to Create, List, Update and Delete customers. A customer is made of up the following attributes:
• Name;
• Email;
• Telephone;
• Address;
? Street;
? City;
? State;
? Zip.
The web application should use MVVM or MVW patterns, splitting logic into separate files (e.g.: app.js, create.js, list.js, etc.) and JSON files as the storage mechanism for each customer record.
